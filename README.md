# Today I Learned

### Background

In 2022, I was a neuroscientist living in Germany. At the time, my girlfriend lived across the world in Washington, D.C.
Separated by the Atlantic ocean and several time zones, it was difficult to find activities that we could share in.
We had to be inventive.

At some point, we started inventing small tasks and games -- anchors for our conversations. 
Once of these tasks was to learn something, however small, every day, and to share it with the other person.
We tried to learn the serious, the fascinating, and the absurd. And to be sure that we remembered our learnings,
we'd text the other csome cryptic summary of our learnings: "remind me: <i>marbles</i>". 
As you can imagine, we often forgot what these key words meant, and so our learnings were lost. I dreamt of a better way of managing these learnings: 
An app that we could use to remember -- and, later, reminisce about -- our learnings.

### What Now?

Fast forward to 2024. I'm now a software engineer at AWS, and I have the tools and knowledge to create this app.
So, now I will. And I'm calling it ***Today I Learned***. It will be a simple social media app, insofar as any social media app can be simple,
designed for sharing learnings with other users.

### TIL, With Me?

But I've never created a mobile app. And I want to learn the Go programming language, which I'll user server-side. 
And, in the spirit of the app itself, I want to share my learnings. So, I figured, why not track my progress from design to deployment? 
Hopefully, if you're creating your first app, you'll learn something along with me.
And if you're an experienced developer, hopefully you can tell me what horrendous mistakes I've made along the way.
